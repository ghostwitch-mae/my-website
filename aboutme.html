                    Hi! I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Queens College, born and raised in New York. When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me lost in a book, sewing something fun, or deep in a K-drama or anime binge. Gaming is also a big part of my life—right now, Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves have my full attention.
                    I'm passionate about mobile development and dream of becoming a mobile software developer. Java was my first programming language, and it’s still my favorite. Right now, I'm working on a super cool app with my friends called HalalBytes (temporary name)—check out the projects section for more details!
                    Family means everything to me, and I love spending time with them. Horimiya is my favorite manga, 3 Idiots is my comfort movie, and my go-to shows are Supernatural and BBC Sherlock. And when it comes to desserts, chocolate ice cream is my ultimate weakness.
                    Fun fact? I pick up hands-on activities ridiculously fast—whether it’s skateboarding, ice skating, or skiing, I can usually get the basics down in minutes (not pro-level, but enough to surprise people!).
